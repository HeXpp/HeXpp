## Hiya! 👋🔥

I'm **HeXp**, a 14 y/o student, programmer, hacker, pentester, UI/UX designer from Málaga.

- 🏆 **Achievements:** I hacked the contactless payment system from the public bus transport system of Málaga in a month (this includes decrypting/guessing memory keys, understanding how it worls and making tools to exploit vulnerabilities). After that, I hacked the contactless payment system used in all the cities in Andalusia (Consorcio de Transportes).
- 💻 **Programming languages:** PHP, JS, Node.js and a bit of Python (I'm also trying to learn Java to make Android apps). I also know HTML and CSS, but those aren't commonly considered a programming language.
- 😃 **Hobbies:** Homemade servers, hardware modifications, custom roms (specially those based in AOSP) and IoT projects with cheap boards like Pi Zero W or ESP32/32Cam.
- 🌍 **Languages:** I can speak Spanish (natively) and English (C1), but I'm looking forward to learn German as a third language.
- 💁 **More details about me:** I'm 1,75m tall and I weight around 63kg.
